I will have a 30-minute live coding interview based on these pointers:
The process would involve:

30-minute programming session.

Richard will provide instructions to evaluate how I follow and implement tasks, assessing my real working style and problem-solving abilities.

Tasks will focus on day-to-day coding responsibilities, such as creating forms and real-time error validation.

Richard emphasized using forms with Formik in React and proper state management. Currently, their team uses Redux, but I plan to demonstrate Zustand as an alternative during this session. They heavily rely on Tailwind CSS for styling.

He highlighted correctly utilizing TypeScript, demonstrating structured and clear conversion from JavaScript to fully typed TypeScript. They've transitioned from create-react-app to Vite.

Optimized live coding interview scenario:

Scope & Requirements:

Checkout or user registration form with real-time validation.

Technical Preferences:

Simulate asynchronous actions with fake API requests using promises or dummy data.

Demonstrate both front-end validation and error handling for simulated API responses.

Keep form structure simple due to time constraints.

State Management & Styling:

Emphasize Zustand's state persistence, form state, and integration with Formik.

Use Formik's built-in validation methods.

Focus primarily on problem-solving, scalable code architecture, proper base structure, consumer/producer components, smart/dumb components. UI design and responsiveness should be secondary.

TypeScript Conversion:

Begin with TypeScript immediately.

Demonstrate reusable types/interfaces clearly.
